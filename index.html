        <h1>What started it all?</h1>
        <p class="par_about">
            When Lan moved to Sixtown in 19XX, Sixtown was a food-desert that had limited food options. As such, most Sixtown residents had to look towards neighboring towns, Seventown and Fivetown, to buy takeout, which was not only more expensive, but also time-consuming for the Sixtown residents. Seeing an opportunity, Lan opened up Lan's Restaurant to offer affordable and fresh food to serve her community. Every community needs a Lan :D
